        "abstract": "As interests and understanding of blockchain technology expand in mind and market so do\nconsortiums, collectives, think tanks, working groups and alliances. While the establishment of\nvarious productive technology commons within a capitalist system continue- the shortcomings of\nduplicated efforts, siloed research, misaligned capital and the often dissident tension between Open\nSource and Intellectual Property create undue stress on managing collective effort.\nThe aim of this paper topic is to explore how Curation Markets: the combination of\nNon-Fungible-Tokens (NFTs) and Token Bonding Curves (TBCs)) could create a tokenised\nattribution model to incentivise cross-collaboration and share the risks and rewards through\ndistributed collective ownership for Commons like RWoT to more effectively coordinate and earn\nfrom value co-created around shared goals.",

For professional entities it is a reasonable assumption that this is worst that can happen. However, a web of trust solutions that aims for broader use of average users has to deal with two even more problematic scenarios: lost and stolen keys. In both cases does the original owner do not have any longer access, while in the second case the key is additionally compromised.",

The first thing his software does is do an INTEGRITY CHECK of Donna's claim itself. Is it properly formed? Has it expired? Is it properly signed by the issuer? Is it properly countersigned by the subject? If it fails any of these INTEGRITY CHECKS, Bob will not even know about it, and the whole message and its claims will be rejected.",

        "abstract": "It is important to be wary of the privacy implications and trade-offs of verifiable attribute, claim, and attestation systems. As with other ecosystems, different design decisions lead to different trade-offs. There is rarely one solution to a particular problem. Rather there tend to be a handful of solutions that make different trade-offs. This paper focuses on how privacy may be preserved using two different designs: same-origin identity and self-sovereign identity. We briefly analyze the trade-offs that come with each design approach in an attempt to progress a conversation in the community related to the appropriate path forward for a particular set of use cases.",

        "abstract": "In order to facilitate privacy it is useful to let the user be able to create multiple unlinked identities to be used for different purposes. Some questions/challenges around this:\n\nHow should the user practically manage the keys of multiple identities (assuming for simplicity that one key controls one identity)\n\nHD wallets are a good method of managing a virtually unlimited number of keys. If HD wallets are used, should the user be responsible for storing and maintaining the seed? Is this too much of a burden for the user?\n\nIf the user loses their HD wallet seed, can there be a reset feature that restores all their identities/personas? If so, how would this recovery work?\n\nA Shamir Secret Sharing scheme can be used to recover the seed from a threshold of recovery members holding pieces of the seed. This protects against loss, but not against compromise. Is there a good way that the seed can be replaced instead of reconstructed to also protect against compromise (similar to discussion about key recovery)?",

This means semantics baked into the lowest levels of memory storage, self-describing protocols which let anything talk with anything else, blockchain-like abilities for decentralized data storage and computation. Our approach addresses many issues people are tackling in a variety of projects (web of trust, blockchain, semantic web, decentralized applications, federated identity, ease of interoperability, rapid code evolution with massive reuse, mesh networks, etc.) through a unified approach. We know providing such a different approach creates barriers to adoption and understanding, but we also know that applications in Ceptr will be able to be developed faster, easier and should significantly outperform projects which have been cobbled together from more traditional tools.",

        "abstract": "A secure management of digital identities is an obvious requirement for digital technologies and applications (digital payment, online shops, insurances, etc.). It is typically achieved by pre-defined certificate-based trust. However, pre-defined trust on centralized instances is not always possible or wanted for trust management and the “web-of-trust” emerged as a decentralized alternative. It determines a trust value by aggregating reputations issued by other entities, where the reputations represent a subjective evaluation of the user satisfaction. This mechanism is also suitable for the identity management when using reputations to indicate (the subjective impression of) an identity’s trustworthiness. However, such traditional reputation-based web-of-trust approaches suffer from Sybil attacks, where an identity can increase the own trust value by creating synthetic identities issuing reputations.",

However, all of the transactions, licensing revenues, interests and equity generated by that intellectual property requires authentication, signatures, verification authorities and trustable timestamping.

        "abstract": "Current public key infrastructure for personal communication is limited, hard to use, and harder to use correctly. User adoption is very low, even in relation to the userbase already using OpenPGP-based software for communication. A PKI can and must be created which does not require expert-level knowledge of public-key encryption to use properly. A PKI's job is to store and retrieve public keys and their respective global identity bindings: identifiers of personal location or accounts controlled by the key's owner and associated with that key. The key is queried via a bound identity attribute (e.g. email address), and the PKI will also return all certificates asserting the validity of these identity bindings.",

Moving things dynamically change context, and when they do, there is the opportunity, or requirement, to perform a transaction. These transactions will become increasingly automated and will dramatically affect areas such as Trade Finance.\n\nCombining Physical Automation (IoT/IoMT) with Financial and Transactional Automation (Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains) will result in Economic Automation. For instance, autonomous shipping containers will negotiate their own transit, dynamically adjust their insurance, validate their modes of transportation (Is this the right ship?), and perform other operations without the need to involve humans in-the-loop.\n\nA key enabler to create this Economically Automated world will be the ability for all of the parties involved, who are not going to be humans, to be able to obtain and trust their respective identities.",

I start with grounding individual \nsovereignty in the Enlightenment and identity in its core function of correlation, then propose core \ncharacteristics of a self‐sovereign identity system.

Internet Identity Workshop next week; then I’m speaking at the blockchain conference Consensus about identity; next I am part of the team putting together the first ID2020 Summit on Digital Identity at the United Nations; and finally I'm hosting the second #RebootingWebOfTrust design workshop on decentralized identity.\n\nAt all of these events I want to share a vision for how we can enhance the ability of digital identity to enable trust while preserving individual privacy. This vision is what I call “Self-Sovereign Identity”.\n\nWhy do we need this vision now? Governments and companies are sharing an unprecedented amount of information, cross-correlating everything from viewing habits to purchases, to where people are located during the day, to where they sleep at night, and with whom they associate. In addition, as the Third World enters the computer age, digital citizenship is providing Third World residents with greater access to human rights and to the global economy. When properly designed and implemented, self-sovereign identity can offer these benefits while also protecting individuals from the ever-increasing control of those in power, who may not have the best interests of the individual at heart.",

A principal may wish to establish his possession of a attestation, without revealing his complete identity. However, attestations should not be bearer instruments. An attestation must be issued in a way so that it is useless to anyone but the person to whom it was originally issued.\n\nThis proposal provides a \"forking\" mechanism to issue attestations and spawn new identities from parent identities, in a way that attestations can be attributed to the spawned identity individually.\n\nThe last section provides a federated mechanism for identities to establish their reputation data, both positive and negative, using a public blockchain. Forking is essential for this proposal, because this proposal gives a method to establish a complete history of a single identity’s actions, which could easily become public knowledge. A principal retains control only by spawning subidentities up to the finest level of activities that she wishes to be evaluated as a unit.",

With the ghosts of WWI still lurking, he spoke movingly about the wages of war and ongoing suffering of millions displaced by years of famine and war across Germany, Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Middle East. Nansen stated that the future could not be “built on despair, distrust, hatred, and envy.” Rather, he declared, the first prerequisite for defeating the disease of conflict and war was “an understanding of the cause and nature of the disease itself.” “Such an understanding,” he cautioned, “is certainly not attainable in a day. But the first condition for its final establishment is the sincere will to understand.” 1\n\nA polar explorer and scientist, Nansen was named the League of Nation’s first High Commissioner for Refugees in 1920. Over the next decade he helped hundreds of thousands to return home, while enabling others to become legal residents and find work in the countries where they found refuge. Nansen saw that a primary problem faced by refugees was a lack of internationally recognized identification papers. His solution was the first legal instrument for international protection of refugees, which become known as the “Nansen passport.” [2](http://stories.unhcr.org/nansen-passport- p34721.html)",

Because by the act of us being here in this common space, at this conference, you have found a very simple credential from me -- that I'm willing to spend time here in a place that you are interested in as well.

        "title": "Peer to Peer Degrees of Trust",
        "abstract": "Authenticity is a challenge for any identity solution. In the physical world, at least in America, it is not difficult to change one's identity. In the digital world, there is the problem of bots. The botnet detection market is expected to be worth over one billion USD by 2023, in a landscape where most digital activity is still heavily centralized. These centralized digital solutions have the advantage of being able to track IP addresses, request phone verification, and present CAPTCHAs to users in order to authenticate them. If this problem is so difficult to solve in the centralized world, how much more challenging will it be in the decentralized world, where none of these techniques are available? In this paper, we explore the idea of using a web of trust as a tool to add authenticity to decentralized identifiers (DIDs). We define a framework for deriving relative trust degrees using a given trust metric: a \"trustworthiness\" score for a given identity from the perspective of another identity. It is our intent that this framework may be used as a starting point for an ongoing exploration of graph-based, decentralized trust. We believe this approach may ultimately be used as a foundation for decentralized reputation.",

        "title": "Sovereign Identity Namespaces",
        "abstract": "Sovereign identity is a new type of digital identity that enables a principal(person, group, or thing) to have a digital identity that is completely owned and controlled by the principal. A sovereign identity can never be taken away by another authority. This and other principles of sovereign identity are explained in another paper for the ID2020 Design Shop, A Self­Sovereign Identity Architecture by Christopher Allen, and also in the blog post Why Companies Need Self­Sovereign Identity from Phil Windley at Brigham Young University. The main enabler of sovereign identity is distributed ledger technology (“blockchain”). However, to implement the principles of sovereign identity, these principles must be followed right down to the most foundational architectural component: how identities are registered on a distributed ledger. This paper proposes the use of three globally unique namespaces: 1. DIDs(decentralized identifiers)—machine­generated globally unique identifiers that do not have cryptographic properties. 2. CIDs (cryptographic identifiers)—machine­generated globally unique identifiers with cryptographic properties. 3. Aliases—registered identifiers from other global namespaces that simplify discovery of DIDs and CIDs.",

In the internet age, corporations structured around monetizing defensible intellectual property frequently utilize common technology to produce innovative products that work across shared infrastructure, including most of the core platforms and building blocks of what we know as the internet industry. These technology commons include the Internet and the standards that make it run. There are several standards bodies that support the development of these standards, primarily the IETF, W3C, and OASIS.\n\nThe W3C defined web standards that could be used by everyone (including companies, individuals, nonprofits, governments) for the creation of the web. As one common saying summarized the thinking of the early 00s, “Nobody owns it, everyone can use it, and everyone can improve it.”",

In fact, adding nodes, while increasing the integrity of the system, actually reduces its overall throughput.\n\nIn this paper, we will briefly describe Plenum, the consensus protocol used for the Sovrin Distributed Identity Ledger. Then we’ll discuss a set of mechanisms that allow us to scale it.",

I believe that as we evolve social software to better serve our needs and the needs of the groups that we are involved in, we need to figure out how to apply an understanding of how human groups behave and work.\n\nOne useful concept I use I call \"Progressive Trust\". The basic idea is to model how trust works in the real world, between real people, rather then solely relying on mathematical or cryptographic trust. This is how I typically explain progressive trust when I meet someone in-person at a conference:\n\nYou are now spending your most precious resource, your most unrenewable commodity -- time, in order to listen and understand what I have to say.\n\nWhy do you do so? Because by the act of us being here in this common space, at this conference, you have found a very simple credential from me -- that I'm willing to spend time here in a place that you are interested in as well. In turn, I'm willing to spend more time chatting with you for the same reason.",

Bitcoin's scripting system is a rare exception, showing how we can also have a more flexible and useful notion of a cryptographic identity, with flexible validation rules set in advance with evaluatable code. For identity systems separating the tasks of mapping human-relevant identity to cryptographic identity, and managing the cryptographic identity itself, has the potential to simplify both layers, and enable cryptographic identity innovation by removing the need to update all signature validators for every signing-side innovation.",

        "abstract": "When Bitcoin debuted it revealed one characteristic that was very different from the world of traditional PKI: a proliferation of keys. As used in PGP, in X.509 certificates used by TLS, and in other protocols, the number of private keys are few and they they do not expire for many years. Instead, to maximize privacy Bitcoin rapidly cycles through keys, discarding old keys from past transactions as soon as the public key is revealed and the coins are spent. Since each address is hashed from a public key, this means that a Bitcoin user needs to deal with a large lot of keypairs. The traditional answer for this problem has been wallets — which collect and manage keys so that users don’t have to. The earliest Bitcoin wallets still faced challenges. That’s because the Bitcoin Core and early clients generated each key randomly. Unfortunately, this methodology requires careful (and constant) backups to ensure continued access to all funds. It also opens some privacy loopholes; because new key generation wasn’t trivial, single keys were often reused when they shouldn't have been. Transactions could be correlated if they used the same address (and thus keypair) for change, requiring even more keys.",

        "abstract": "Sovereign identity is a new type of digital identity that enables a principal(person, group, or thing) to have a digital identity that is completely owned and controlled by the principal. A sovereign identity can never be taken away by another authority. This and other principles of sovereign identity are explained in another paper for the ID2020 Design Shop, A Self­Sovereign Identity Architecture by Christopher Allen, and also in the blog post Why Companies Need Self­Sovereign Identity from Phil Windley at Brigham Young University. The main enabler of sovereign identity is distributed ledger technology (“blockchain”). However, to implement the principles of sovereign identity, these principles must be followed right down to the most foundational architectural component: how identities are registered on a distributed ledger. This paper proposes the use of three globally unique namespaces: 1. DIDs(decentralized identifiers)—machine­generated globally unique identifiers that do not have cryptographic properties. 2. CIDs (cryptographic identifiers)—machine­generated globally unique identifiers with cryptographic properties. 3. Aliases—registered identifiers from other global namespaces that simplify discovery of DIDs and CIDs.",

This paper attempts to describe the role that identity plays in enabling multiple actors, each operating from their own perspective, to rely upon one another to improve their own situational awareness and take action. It then explores the expectations and pressures that identity enables actors to place upon one another, as well as the way that those expectations and pressures can change in response to shifts in the external environment. It details the relationship between privacy and transparency in the identity realm and the impact that this has on the regulation of the community as a complex adaptive system more generally. Finally, it concludes with a series of proposals for specific technical solutions to address some of the tension balancing requirements that are necessary to enable communities to self-regulate amidst changing circumstances.",

        "abstract": "Attribute Based Credentials using Camenisch Lysyanskaya signature schemes typically require a fixed list of attributes defined before issue time in order to validate the correct attribute signature for revealed and unrevealed attributes, including predicate proofs. This poses problems when an attribute based credential system is to be used for arbitrary data graphs or schema definitions with optional fields, multi-valued fields or nested data structures, such as data schemas in wide use, documented on sites like schema.org.\n\nIn an effort to allow JSON-LD data structures to leverage attribute based credentials and zero knowledge signature schemes, this paper outlines differences, requirements and possible options for representing JSON-LD data in attribute based credential schemes such as the one in use by the Sovrin network, implemented in the Hyperledger Indy project.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, data technologies have emerged with the potential to differentiate and protect identity in ways that are similar, but superior, to those used in the physical world for millennia. Identity in the physical world has typically been asserted via decentralized mechanisms, mainly paper; i.e., identity is managed individually with claims and attributes that are verified by third parties. Modern computing techniques have centralized this process with various registries and databases that have become repositories for unintentional exploitation. New decentralized technologies, such as blockchains, hash tables and semantic data graphs can enable the design and deployment of a decentralized identity architecture that can vastly improve security and privacy of individuals and entities in the digital world. This will lead to users on the internet becoming individuals with sovereign rights and ownership and control over their digital selves in similar ways that we have control over our physical selves.",

On that journey I encountered two different uses of the word “trust”. The first instance was a sticker on the back of a car I saw parked outside as I was leaving. The first instance “The Sexiest Thing is Trust” a quote from a Toni Amos song on a bumper sticker is referring to interpersonal human to human trust.\n\nThe second instance on a advertisement in the Zurich airport \"Trust. Five extremely demanding letters.\" is talking about trust in organizational systems and processes. It is an advertisement for PICTET “Founded in Geneva in 1805…one of the leading independent wealth and asset managers in Europe”\n\nOne is about deeply human feelings and connection within human relationships the other is about an institutions ability to support individuals hoarding wealth for themselves.",

A principal may wish to establish his possession of a attestation, without revealing his complete identity. However, attestations should not be bearer instruments. An attestation must be issued in a way so that it is useless to anyone but the person to whom it was originally issued.\n\nThis proposal provides a \"forking\" mechanism to issue attestations and spawn new identities from parent identities, in a way that attestations can be attributed to the spawned identity individually.\n\nThe last section provides a federated mechanism for identities to establish their reputation data, both positive and negative, using a public blockchain. Forking is essential for this proposal, because this proposal gives a method to establish a complete history of a single identity’s actions, which could easily become public knowledge. A principal retains control only by spawning subidentities up to the finest level of activities that she wishes to be evaluated as a unit.",

These transactions will become increasingly automated and will dramatically affect areas such as Trade Finance.\n\nCombining Physical Automation (IoT/IoMT) with Financial and Transactional Automation (Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains) will result in Economic Automation. For instance, autonomous shipping containers will negotiate their own transit, dynamically adjust their insurance, validate their modes of transportation (Is this the right ship?), and perform other operations without the need to involve humans in-the-loop.\n\nA key enabler to create this Economically Automated world will be the ability for all of the parties involved, who are not going to be humans, to be able to obtain and trust their respective identities.",

This comes, however, at the cost of human memorability. The algorithms capable of generating globally unique identifiers automatically produce random strings of characters that have no human meaning. This leads to the axiom about identifiers known as Zooko’s Triangle: \"human-meaningful, decentralized, secure—pick any two\".\n\nThere are of course many use cases where it is desirable to discover a DID starting from a human-friendly identifier—a natural language name, a domain name, or a conventional address for a DID owner, such as a mobile telephone number, email address, Twitter handle, blog URL, etc. However, the problem of mapping human-friendly identifiers to DIDs (and doing so in a way that can be verified and trusted) is out-of-scope for this specification.",

Since we are living in the digital world of blockchain there is currently no definite way of representing a identity that is 100% true digitally and in the real world. However; by incorporating the concept of Web of Trust in a crypto wallet, an identity can be created to display throughout the entire web; the level of confidence there is in a specific address. Since cryptocurrency wallets can be considered a form of identity, functional identity can give us the framework in which to view this identity system based on how it works.",

Therefore, the main measure of an operational reputation system should be whether people voluntarily decide to use it. If so, it would follow that value has been added, either by lowering transaction costs or enabling trade that hadn’t been possible before. Additionally, a backwards-looking measure of success might be the predictive power of the model—did an agent defect when cooperation was predicted, and vice versa.",

These credentials are composed of statements called verifiable claims.\n\nStarting in 2013, the W3C Credentials Community Group started to work in earnest on solutions in this space followed shortly thereafter by the Rebooting Web of Trust Community and W3C Verifiable Claims Working Group. These groups, composed of 150+ individuals and organizations, are currently focused on the creation, storage, transmission, and verification of digital credentials via the Internet.\n\nThis document is a primer for those that want to learn about the Verifiable Claims initiative, the use cases and ecosystem, a basic overview of the technology, and how to get involved.",

        "abstract": "Most user authentication methods and identity proving systems rely on a centralized database. Such information storage presents a single point of compromise from a security perspective. If this system is compromised it poses a direct threat to users digital identities. This paper proposes a decentralized authentication method, called the Horcrux1 protocol, in which there is no such single point of compromise. The protocol relies on decentralized identifiers (DIDs) under development by the W3C Verifiable Claims Community Group and the concept of selfsovereign identity. To accomplish this, we propose specification and implementation of a decentralized biometric credential storage option via blockchains using DIDs and DID documents within the IEEE 2410-2017 Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS).",

Quite simply, Andrieu says, \"Identity is how we keep track of people and things and, in turn, how they keep track of us.\" It's an astute description that cuts through the confusion of what an identity database should or shouldn't encompass by instead suggesting that models need only include what's required for persistent identification.\n\nHowever, the content design of an identity system is only half the battle. There are also questions of jurisdiction, management, and oversight. In other words, once you have an identity system, who runs it, and who are they beholden to? That's where self-sovereign identity enters the picture, as an orthogonal way to look at the question of identity systems.",

        "abstract": "In November 2015 Facebook's share price broke $100 USD/share, for a total valuation of $290 billion USD. This is evidence that both Facebook and the market understand the value of controlling and leveraging personal data. However, the now-conventional absorb-everything design of Facebook is a blunt one. Employing users as passive producers with no control of their own data only scratches the surface of what is possible with networks of information and identity. Some of these constraints arise from Facebook's centralization, something that tends to worsen as an organization grows in size. There are limits to the amount of trust this sort of centralized authority can garner. This often results in punitive postures: democracies come with the expectation that citizens be forever watchful of their government; while corporations are watched over by regulatory bureaus and further deterred by class-action suits.  Decentralized systems that are engineered to prevent concentrating power as they grow avoid this. They can in fact increase their credibility as more users provide their assessments as input. Protocols and structures that are distributed and self-sovereign also offer significantly improved robustness, portability, and versatility than conventional centralized or escrowed processes — especially when combined with secure cryptography.",

A blockchain network can be used to store these documents.

For identity systems separating the tasks of mapping human-relevant identity to cryptographic identity, and managing the cryptographic identity itself, has the potential to simplify both layers, and enable cryptographic identity innovation by removing the need to update all signature validators for every signing-side innovation.",

        "abstract": "In most of the developing world people tend to have poor documentary evidence to prove their identity and to access their entitlements. Regulations might allow for identity credentials to be attested by a trusted third­party such as a solicitor, priest or village chieftain. But these attestations are typically low­fidelity paperware affidavits, with wet signatures. They are easy to fake and have limited utility or credibility ­ particularly as the basis for proving identity in digital applications. This has led us to research potential methods to digitise and democratise peer attestations so that any individual can have their identity assertions validated and enriched.",

        "abstract": "The term “identity” is a challenge. Both laypeople and experts struggle to communicate clearly about it. The term has numerous rich and useful meanings. That same flexibility and expressivity also makes it easy to misunderstand subtle nuances and often leads to ideological debate rather than understanding and applications. We compensate with adjectives, creating new phrases like “digital identity” or “legal identity”, but we often still speak past each other. We regularly refer to “identities” as things that are assigned to us or that we own, things we control or present, instead of using more rigorous terms such as “identifiers” or “credentials”. This fluidity often confuses because, at its core, identity is an emergent phenomenon that doesn’t have an existence independent of the observer.  We propose using “correlation” instead of “identity” when discussing concrete identities in identity systems. It isn’t a word-for-word replacement, but using it will improve the conversation. We argue that “correlation” provides a more concise and clear understanding of how identity is created and applied in both digital and real-world systems, and that using it as an alternative to “identity” will improve communication and understanding.",

If HD wallets are used, should the user be responsible for storing and maintaining the seed? Is this too much of a burden for the user?\n\nIf the user loses their HD wallet seed, can there be a reset feature that restores all their identities/personas? If so, how would this recovery work?\n\nA Shamir Secret Sharing scheme can be used to recover the seed from a threshold of recovery members holding pieces of the seed. This protects against loss, but not against compromise. Is there a good way that the seed can be replaced instead of reconstructed to also protect against compromise (similar to discussion about key recovery)?",

In the rare circumstances where developers are validating their downloaded components they’re using homegrown validation tools and often manually verifying hashes. Typically file hashes are stored on the same server as the hashed file to be validated. If the download is compromised, the hash will be too. Developers need a way of sending and receiving decentralized, secure, and human meaningful information that can be used to secure software components and applications.",

        "abstract": "Much of what we know as a species has accreted through experience. We’ve seen things work and fail, and we’ve reacted: we've created checks and balances, institutions and procedures, making calculated tradeoffs for the net benefit of individuals and communities. This wisdom is embodied in laws, social norms, patterns, proverbs, and traditions.  The digital landscape, with its turbulent pace and its jockeying technologies, is a new dimension of shared experience. Identity is a central aspect of that new dimension. Who we are, how we interact, how we give and receive value, and how we hold one another accountable are all integral to identity — and they are every bit as important to the digital landscape as they were in pre-digital times. Software and hardware are more malleable than human nature. Building the code and machines that run a social network can be done in months or years, and mostly by those writing the code — but changes in the nature of friendship, trust, family, employment, and other human relationships are evolutionary, incremental, and undirected, and they unfold over generations and centuries more often than months. This mismatch in evolution matters; we risk rushing into digital construction, and not pausing to consult moral calipers or experiential plumb lines. Widespread surveillance, doxing, online bullying, and the existance of child pornography are all evidence that our digital universe has the same opportunities and pitfalls familiar in other contexts.",

        "abstract": "Identity is how we recognize, remember, and respond to specific people and things. Identity systems acquire, correlate, apply, reason over, and govern information assets of subjects, identifiers, attributes, raw data, and context. That’s the functional approach to identity.\n\nHow we think about these processes and assets is driven by why we use identity in the first place; our primary uses of identity shape our internal mental models, which in turn shape the kinds of solutions we build. Differing priorities and perspectives also make it challenging to discuss identity with people speaking from alternate mental models.\n\nWe’ve identified five distinct mental models for identity, each with its own framing, its own purpose, and its own defining question. These are five valid, independent mental models of identity. By understanding them, we can better understand how apparently disjoint ideas of identity relate to each other, enabling the discussion and engineering of better, more broadly useful identity systems.",

The privacy problem is a major one: I may not want to disclose my recommendations in public, nor I want to show everyone who endorsed me, unless in private.\n\nIn this article we explore possible ways to create and present proofs of reputation, which provide limited and owner-controlled information about reputation. We restrict to human beings only as we are primarily concerned with linkage between reputation and identity. First we identify some properties of reputation that are relevant to our study.",

It is typically achieved by pre-defined certificate-based trust. However, pre-defined trust on centralized instances is not always possible or wanted for trust management and the “web-of-trust” emerged as a decentralized alternative. It determines a trust value by aggregating reputations issued by other entities, where the reputations represent a subjective evaluation of the user satisfaction. This mechanism is also suitable for the identity management when using reputations to indicate (the subjective impression of) an identity’s trustworthiness. However, such traditional reputation-based web-of-trust approaches suffer from Sybil attacks, where an identity can increase the own trust value by creating synthetic identities issuing reputations.",

        "abstract": "How do you identify someone online? Traditionally, the answer has been to use a centralized naming system. Trusted authorities act as the root of a global name space that connects names with public keys to certify who people are. Unfortunately, this classic setup has problems. The earliest complaints focused on the 1988 x.509 standard and said that it was overly complex and overly formal. However, as the internet grew, people soon realized that there was a bigger problem: in a global name space, names quickly failed as a means of unique identity. If someone is verified by a certificate authority (CA) as Christopher Allen, who are they, really? Is it the psychic medium? The UCSF assistant professor? The security technologist? A traditional certificate can’t tell you. CA-based systems also require validation and revocation which recent SSL attacks like HeartBleed have proven have not adequately deployed or scaled to meet security requirements. Other aspects in the centrality of architecture in CA-based systems have also made them vulnerable to new forms of attacks.",

        "abstract": "Reputation systems provide an effective way to build a web of trust on the Internet. They consider the history of interactions between peers to establish a measure for a reputation that can itself be used to support a trust decision. Decentralised reputations systems (DRS) rely on a decentralised computer architecture and a distributed ledger to store and maintain reputation information, so that no single entity has control over that information.\n\nWhile there have been numerous analyses of how reputation may be used, there has to date been no systematic definition of the various aspects that should be considered when a reputation system is being designed. By defining these design considerations, we can come to a consensus about what is and is not important in a system. We can discuss the different ways in which they can be built and we can conduct further research and analysis into specific factors in a structured way.",

A computer algorithm can then accept new members, if enough existing members endorsed them. However, can we trust this approach? When the community is big, and it can be as big as the global community of all humanity, it is not easy to identify the real members of the community, if there is no central authority to do so. In this case I claim not only that subjective trust won't help much in identifying the correct community members, but rather that an objective endorsement – one that does not require the endorser even to know the endorsed person – is the best key for establishing community membership. We call a graph of such endorsements, where the claims made by the signers are objective claims, a Trustless Web-of-trust (TWOT). In the global community of all humanity – the politician and the shy, or even the honest and the crook, should all have the same egalitarian membership within the community.",

Bitcoin allows anyone to send value without a trusted depository or custodian. However, due to limitations to block confirmation, transactions require up to one hour. Additionally, individual micropayments below several cents are not worthwhile on the Bitcoin blockchain as the on-blockchain transaction fees are several cents. Lightning Network conducts net settlement of funds between two participants which allows one to conduct an unlimited amount of transactions off-blockchain, but eventually settling the transactions on-chain.  The Lightning Network does not require cooperation from the counterparty to exit the channel. Both parties have the option to unilaterally close the channel, ending their relationship. Since all parties have multiple multisignature channels with many diferent users on this network, one can send a payment to any other party across this network.",

The goal of the summit that proceeds the ID2020 Workshop is to foster a goal conversation, build a working coalition to identify and create circumstances under which legal digital identity can be given to all individuals at risk.\n\nIt is important however to first discuss what is identity. Who are we without an ID. Is it obligatory or even needed to have one? Are there situations when having no identity is desired? While with paper documents we can achieve anonymity by leaving them at home, digital identity follows us around wherever we go. Once we get an identity we become identifiable wherever we go. What follows: are there ways to provide temporal anonymity even in the world of digital identity?\n\nWhat is an identity? In psychology identity or self-concept is not connected to anything physical. According to Encyclopedia Brittanica “it has to do with what the truth of judgments of personal identity consists of and how it can be known. Equivalently, it has to do with the nature of the persistence of persons through time and their awareness of such persistence”. It is liberating: I think therefore I am.",

In general ActivityPub follows the client-server paradigm that has been popular on the World Wide Web, while restoring some level of decentralization. Current implementations of ActivityPub go as far as to bring a level of decentralization akin to email,2 but there are many opportunities to go further. By attaching public keys to the profiles of actors (users) on the network and using Linked Data Signatures, we can add a web of trust to the federated social web and use it to enhance user privacy and to assert the integrity of messages sent over the network. By using a decentralized identifier system such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) we can move fully from a decentralized to a distributed system,3 by escaping the core centralization mechanisms of DNS and SSL certificate authorities.",

A blockchain with a fully featured virtual machine such as Ethereum (with its Ethereum VM or EVM) or the recent Bitcoin sidechain project Rootstock (also EVM-based) provides a rich scripting language with which to build tools that can be used in a PKI.\n\nA blockchain with such a virtual machine allows the user to send transactions creating blockchain-native programs, sometimes called \"smart contracts\" or simply \"contracts\". These programs have an associated address and expose API functions which can be called by sending a transaction to the address with a data message containing the signature of the function along with its parameters. The programs are run by miners and they have associated storage and/or funds (Ether in the case of the Ethereum blockchain) which is updated upon contract execution.",

Here the meaning of identity is derived from the\ncharacteristics of the identity system, that is, what the identity system provides. Instead of defining\nidentity a priori, this white paper describes an identity system and then defines identity within the context\nof that identity system. Many of the features of the identity system has been influenced and inspired other\nproposed systems such as Open Reputation.\n[1] [2] [3]\nThis paper argues that an identity system that\nsimultaneously provides a high degrees of sovereignty, security and privacy is best obtained via an open\nplatform that employs distributed consensus protocols and modern cryptographic techniques.",

Ceptr is a rebuild of much of the computing stack optimized for decentralized sense-making, computation and composability. This means semantics baked into the lowest levels of memory storage, self-describing protocols which let anything talk with anything else, blockchain-like abilities for decentralized data storage and computation. Our approach addresses many issues people are tackling in a variety of projects (web of trust, blockchain, semantic web, decentralized applications, federated identity, ease of interoperability, rapid code evolution with massive reuse, mesh networks, etc.) through a unified approach. We know providing such a different approach creates barriers to adoption and understanding, but we also know that applications in Ceptr will be able to be developed faster, easier and should significantly outperform projects which have been cobbled together from more traditional tools.",

        "abstract": "Given the goal of being useful in decentralized applications, it’s important that a PoP system is itself decentralized, self-sovereign and privacy preserving. In such an environment, it’s impossible to prevent the creation of multiple accounts. Instead, it needs to be difficult to accumulate sufficient reputation across many accounts. An account’s reputation score can then act as the probability that it belongs to an individual. In order to limit actions to unique people, applications building on top would specify the score required to participate.\n\nReputation would most likely be acquired through a Web-of-Trust model. As users trust each other (verify that they are unique), a strong network of relationships forms. The system could then use the topology the network to generate a reputation score, similar to PageRank. In order to output a global score, you would need to “anchor” to some trusted accounts, in order differentiate the real network from shadow networks of fake accounts, who all trust each other, but aren’t connected to legitimate accounts.",

        "abstract": "We propose to facilitate the collaborative drafting of a technical paper that describes the principles and key design considerations for a use case that utilizes Decentralized IDs and proximity verification to generate an intelligent, self-optimizing web of trust. We will also describe other issues, including adaptive functionality, user centric needs analysis and cognitive models, and a model for tokenized behavioral economics.\n\nWe base much of our work on key design considerations for decentralized identity, claims and reputation, developed by C. Allen, M. Sporny, D. Reed, and many others (see references), at previous RWOT design conferences, as well as Proof of Personhood, developed by M. Borge, E. Kokoris-Kogias, P. Jovanovic, L. Gasser, N. Gailly, B. Ford, at the ƒcole polytechnique fŽdŽrale de Lausanne, Switzerland.",

She came back to society curious to understand the logical structures underpinning \"reality\", such as politics, economics and philosophy.\n\nDuring her continued period of study, Toni Lane sensed an oncoming dissolution of many “principled” theories, like democracy, based on the modern day disconnect from real world practice and founding theory of logic. Archaic human rationality encouraged the prevalence of threats, scarcity, and violence to survive as the myopic heartbeat of governing principles; this could not continue. Should fear rule over self-sovereignty, self-actualization, community and deep empathy, characteristics Miss Lane understood to be basic responsibilities of being alive, the democracy bubble was going to pop.\n\nToni Lane came in contact with blockchain technology in 2011, and she was hooked.\n\nNotably, Toni is working on CULTU.RE, creating competitive marketplaces for governance and standards for self-sovereign identity. As a humanitarian, Toni Lane used Bitcoin as a tool for direct response to the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone.\n\nToni Lane is a co-founder of CoinTelegraph, one of the largest media networks in the blockchain industry, and an advisor at over 15 companies in the blockchain space. Miss Lane serves as a thought leader for many prestigious organizations including: SingularityU, IFTF, P&G, Cisco, HSBC and the United Nations (which she believes should not take money from dictators, nor should they allow member states to appoint a nation as a \"womens/human rights representative\" if it is culturally unacceptable for a woman in that country to drive a car).   In other worlds, Toni Lane lives the life of an artist. As a vocalist, Toni Lane recently performed Chelsea Hotel #2 at the tribute to Leonard Cohen in the Hotel Chelsea. As a poet, Miss Lane is working on publishing her first collection entitled, “EUPHORIA SPEAKING”.\n\nTo shift paradigms in the art world, Toni Lane has founded the “immateralism” (post art) movement. Post Art (Immaterialism) uses consciousness as a medium. The art pieces Miss Lane showcases are other people. Examples of her work can be seen through readings of extreme empaths, rain dances, shared dreaming, and tangible, evidence based works of art showcasing the conscious ability to transcend illusions of time and space. Her work as an artist is focused on giving scientists evidence of the unknown; unlocking forgotten knowledge in our consciousness to guide the next generation of scientific discovery.",

        "abstract": "Currently, the Web provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for the dissemination of information via links. Unfortunately, there is no generalized mechanism that enables verifying that a fetched resource has been delivered without unexpected manipulation. Would it be possible to create an extensible and multipurpose cryptographic link that provides discoverability, integrity, and scheme agility? This paper proposes a linking solution that decouples integrity information from link and resource syntaxes, enabling verification of any representation of a resource from any type of link. We call this approach Resource Integrity Proofs (RIPs). RIPs provide a succinct way to link to resources with cryptographically verifiable content integrity. RIPs can be combined with blockchain technology to create discoverable proofs of existence to off-chain resources.",

        "title": "DID (Decentralized Identifier) Specification",
        "abstract": "Conventional identity management systems are based on centralized authorities such as corporate directory services, certificate authorities, or domain name registries. From the standpoint of cryptographic trust verification, each of these centralized authorities serves as its own root of trust. To make identity management work across these systems requires implementing federated identity management.\n\nThe emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT), sometimes referred to as blockchain technology, provides the opportunity to implement fully decentralized identity management (DIDM). In DIDM, all participants with identities (called identity owners) share a common root of trust in the form of a globally distributed ledger (or a decentralized P2P network that provides similar capabilities).\n\nIn a DIDM architecture, each identity owner can be identified on a ledger with a key-value pair. The index key is a decentralized identifier (DID) and the value is its associated DID description object (DDO). Together these form a DID record. Each DID record is cryptographically secured by private keys under the identity owner’s control. Following the dictums of Privacy by Design, each identity owner may have as many DID records as necessary to respect the identity owner’s desired separation of identities, personas, and contexts.",

Some are useful.\r\n\r\nIf the entire team isn't pulling in the same direction, you're wasting energy. Unfortunately, it can also be a waste of energy to develop extensive requirements specifications before starting work. Even worse, it is definitely a waste to rework and rework and rework because core requirements aren't being met.\r\n\r\nEven the best requirements need to change. The marketplace. Technology. People.

        "abstract": "The concept of an open and permissionless system is philosophically appealing. However, there are certain applications that require the concept of trusted identities. At a minimum, all systems that involve voting rely on unique, trustworthy identities to cast a vote. This includes any consensus mechanism as well as any rating system. Such systems face a dilemma: how can we filter out bad actors without a centralized authority?\n\nIn this paper, I propose the concept of deriving relative trust scores using a given trust metric, one score for each identity from the perspective of another, in a web of trust. I then offer as examples multiple trust metrics, propose the concept of relative reputation, and explore the the idea of obtaining social consensus from a web of trust using trust scores.",

This paper explores the types of modular standards that may be useful in a predicted future blockchain ecosystem containing tens to hundreds of thousands of interoperable blockchains.",

However, it’s also a phrase that dates back almost twenty-five years and has been heavily overloaded with meaning during that time. The classic definition of Web of Trust derives from PGP, but the top Google results refer to a website reputation rating system created by a Finnish internet company. Meanwhile, some use it as a big tent that includes identity authentication & verification, certificate validation, and reputation assessment, while the vibrant blockchain community is also drawing new attention to the classic concept. To build a contemporary Web of Trust, we need to better define it. To do so, we must both understand what the classic Web of Trust was and create a model for the elements of trust that are contained within a more modern definition.",

To that end, I've created more than a hundred designs for multi-currency systems, and my software company has built and deployed dozens of those systems. My current focus is launching Holochain, an alternative to blockchain for running fully P2P distributed applications.\n\nInitially, I put my degree in Artificial Intelligence to use at GM, Chrysler & Hughes, but soon realized I was committed to bringing intelligence to social architectures rather than to computers. I started student-run schools and award-winning, employee-run businesses and discovered that the self-managing feedback loops needed to operate these types of organizations were built on particular patterns of incentives and measurement. I began to unlock the social DNA by which groups operate and uncover the critical role of currencies as carriers of that social DNA.",

        "abstract": "Identity Hubs as currently proposed in the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) are a subset of a general Decentralized Identifier (DID) based user-controlled agent, based on ACLs rather than an object-capabilities (ocap) architecture. The current approach has both security and scalability issues. Transitioning the Hubs design to an ocap model can be achieved by introducing an UMA authorization server as the control endpoint. This avoids creating confused-deputy security issues and expands scale by enabling the hub to delegate access to resources not stored in the hub itself.",

        "abstract": "There are few economic models that support the development of technology commons, while addressing the capitalist use of that common technology. Open source technology is one model. A top-down model is for-profit companies join together to fund a non-profit to develop technology for use by by partner companies (e.g. SWIFT). A bottom-up model emerges from ad-hoc technology communities where bleeding edge and disruptive technology is explored as it is developed, mainly by technologists. Governments pursue their own R&D investment strategy that in effect, invest in technology commons with the end goal of encouraging diverse marketplace. Rebooting Web of Trust (RWoT), along with other events, is one of these bottom-up, ad-hoc technology commons. Participants build relationships with each other as they work together on projects. Results include whitepapers, development of technical specifications, and working code as proof of concepts. The results are part of the technology commons of RWoT and they are valuable, usable, and actively influence technology specifications, product development, and vision.",

For the Rebooting the Web of Trust workshop [1], we prefer a functional approach, focusing our conversation on how identity works and how it is used.\n\nThe varied facets of identity are rich. We inevitably bring our own hot buttons and agendas to any discussion of “what identity is”. Some engage from a philosophical perspective, others psychological. Some dive into political or cultural issues, while others dissect the meta-physical and spiritual. These different perspectives are valid views of identity’s impact on our lives. More than valid. Vital. They help answer the question of “Why?” Why identity matters, why we should care. Unfortunately, they also inflame passions and we sometimes talk past each other to make points that seem irrelevant to others, leaving people frustrated and unheard.",

        "abstract": "There are a few problems that financial institutions have while applying blockchain ideas to their needs, such as limited scalability, trust needed to (semi-)anonymous validators, low speed of transaction settlement, limited privacy of trading positions, absence of AML and KYC mechanisms. All this issues are consequences of the trustless nature of existing blockchain implementations such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and (partially) Ripple that work under the assumption that there should not be a central party that controls the system. This implies the presence of a single blockchain/ledger and global consensus over it. While we fully agree on the need for decentralized financial infrastructure, we believe that techniques that are used in Bitcoin etc are not directly applicable to it. Ideas and mechanisms that are described in this paper are rather simple - 1) each entity has its own ledger(s) that contains its transactions and balances 2) there is no global shared ledger at all 3) there is no global consensus 4) there are no designated validators - financial institutions (gateways and other trusted parties) are validators. To simplify things you can imagine the existing state of the things when each business and individual has its own financial ledger and they are updated individually and then apply the blockchain data structure, cryptographic techniques and a standard set of communication protocols to it. Basically we are describing the financial internet.",

        "title": "Certificate chains for DID-based self-sovereign identities",
        "abstract": "One design element in self-sovereign identity which is becoming common is the idea of decentralized identifiers (DIDs). The ideas is to have an identifier, called a DID, which maps to a descriptor object (DDO) which contains a public key. This mapping can be done in a decentralized way using a blockchain, but other ways could be used as well. The point is that if the root of trust exists in a blockchain, this forms a decentralized PKI (or DPKI). A service interacting with a user would verify a signed message by looking up the DID of the user, mapping this DID to a corresponding key and verifying that the key matches the key that signed the message.\n\nIn a certificate authority based identity system the root of trust is a root key held by a certificate authority (CA). The CA signs certificates containing the keys of sub-CAs which in turn signs keys used by end-users. Thus a service interacting with an end-user can receive a signed message, check the public key that signed the message and follow the certificate chain back to the root CA.",

The main concerns with TLS at this point is that established libraries such as OpenSSL, GnuTLS, and wolfSSL need slight modifications in order to run DID-TLS. In the intermediary, we could utilize this protocol to get Authentication through DIDs working, and then when the modifications in Open-TLS are accepted into the libraries, DID-Authentication could migrate to these libraries.",

One of the most persistent in modern market systems is the Kenysian beauty contest.

Modern market systems inevitably follow this trajectory. A distributed trust ledger may follow a different logic than a market and create other tracks complementary to it. Numerous \"social web\" systems in which karma or other points are accumulated show divergent logics. Example services are Amazon reviews, Wikipedia articles, Facebook likes, Facebook friends, Twitter followers, Instagram likes, and aggregation services like Klout. In many cases, there is a very significant divergence between people who have some sort of accumulated social capital via their contributions and financial capital.",

        "abstract": "For the purpose of this document lets replace Blockchain with DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology). DLT is:\n\nA ledger that generally runs in a hostile environment like the public internet\nIt uses cryptography to try and solve identity and ownership problems in this public environment\nIt uses cryptography to try and automate business processes & reduce latency to accelerate the value of money\nAssets are on and managed on the ledger. Off ledger interactions are considered legacy, slow, and inefficient.\nMost real use cases of this technology are theoretical discussions, unimplemented, without a single live use case with enough scalability, security, or appropriate regulatory framework in place.\nThere is no privacy, all transactions are on this public ledger and all parties can see those transactions.\nDLT is the technology not the actual asset. The asset is the application utilizing the DLT (Stock trades, payments, swap trade, currencies, bonds & coupons, etc).\nTransactions are absolute, there is no reverting the transaction. Chargebacks/returns are a business process because the ledger cannot be reversed. You must initiate a transaction back to the originating party.\nCurrent DLT Identity & Data security mechanisms is 'relatively unused' cryptography built for financial services in 1990's. These mathematics has a certain lifetime because computers and distributed calculations are getting faster & more efficient. The current cryptography is not resistive to quantum computer attacks, 5-10yr max additional lifetime, target window 2021-2026.",

This implicitly forces us to only look in one particular place for one specific resource. The L at the end stands for Location, more specifically, one particular DNS name and the set of locations specified by its owner. Outside of the web, when we point to things, we use the name of the objects instead of the place where we can find it.\n\nConsider buying a book and knowing that its name is library1.com/book-12345 instead of having a name that you can try to find in several libraries - exactly like ISBN.\n\nIf we can assign different names to distinct resources that everyone could agree upon (e.g. for example hash functions applied to its content) then, it doesn't matter where the content, since it could be on multiple locations. Having one singular location is a single point of failure, since that location could disappear, be censored and alterated.",

(All Sovrin stewards are by definition trust anchors.) However the STF V1 did not define additional roles or specific mechanisms for implementing the Sovrin Web of Trust model, leaving that to the STF V2. Based on the learnings from V1 and the progression of open standards for self-sovereign identity (SSI)— specifically DIDs and Verifiable Credentials the Sovrin Trust Framework Working Group is now developing the STF V2. This second generation will fully define the roles and implementation mechanisms for the Sovrin Web of Trust. This short paper will describe the three primary roles in the Sovrin Web of Trust model. Note that most of the terms used here are further defined in the Sovrin Glossary. A visual depiction of how these three roles intertwine to create the Sovrin Web of Trust is shown in this diagram:",

This method helps to ensure that no third-party can compromise the integrity and security of the system as a whole. Entities can use the system to safely authenticate each other and validate keys and certificates. Centralized key management systems (CKMS) manage key and certificate creation, signing, and validity. Specific problems arise when these authorities become unavailable, or the data they control becomes corrupted or known. Central authorities often become choice targets for attackers. This document proposes to meet these requirements with a decentralized blockchain ledger for providing an oracle of trust and leave control over all keys with end users. The use of a blockchain permits globally readable identifiers and public data to be shared in a secure manner that is not vulnerable to the man-in-the-middle attack or system wide compromise and permits consumers to be self-sovereign. This leaves consumers with the task of key management and protection. This document covers various ideas for how users may create, recover, backup, and revoke keys and provides recommended suggestions.",

        "abstract": "Today I head out to a month-long series of events associated with identity: I’m starting with the 22st (!) Internet Identity Workshop next week; then I’m speaking at the blockchain conference Consensus about identity; next I am part of the team putting together the first ID2020 Summit on Digital Identity at the United Nations; and finally I'm hosting the second #RebootingWebOfTrust design workshop on decentralized identity.\n\nAt all of these events I want to share a vision for how we can enhance the ability of digital identity to enable trust while preserving individual privacy. This vision is what I call “Self-Sovereign Identity”.\n\nWhy do we need this vision now? Governments and companies are sharing an unprecedented amount of information, cross-correlating everything from viewing habits to purchases, to where people are located during the day, to where they sleep at night, and with whom they associate. In addition, as the Third World enters the computer age, digital citizenship is providing Third World residents with greater access to human rights and to the global economy. When properly designed and implemented, self-sovereign identity can offer these benefits while also protecting individuals from the ever-increasing control of those in power, who may not have the best interests of the individual at heart.",

        "abstract": "Today’s Internet places control of online identities into the hands of third-parties. Email addresses, usernames, and website domains are borrowed or \"rented\" through DNS, X.509, and social networks. This results in severe usability and security challenges Internet-wide. This paper describes a possible alternate approach called decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI), which returns control of online identities to the entities they belong to. By doing so, DPKI addresses many usability and security challenges that plague traditional public key infrastructure (PKI). DPKI has advantages at each stage of the PKI life cycle. It makes permissionless bootstrapping of online identities possible and provides for the simple creation of stronger SSL certificates. In usage, it can help “Johnny” to finally encrypt thanks to its relegation of public key management to secure decentralized datastores. Finally, it includes mechanisms to recover lost or compromised identifiers.",

Around the clock and around the globe, a world full of people are pumping out contributions small and large: full-length features on Vimeo; video shorts on YouTube; comments on Blogger; discussions on Yahoo! Groups; and tagged-and-titled Del.icio.us bookmarks.”\n\nGiven the myriad contexts in which reputation is being used, it may be surprising to the reader that there is not yet any consensus on this field’s fundamental terminology. We therefore define reputation as “information used to make a value judgment about an object or a person.” But we acknowledge the special role of the reputation(s) of a person and therefore suggest a special term for this: karma. A good example of karma from real life is your credit score.",

Specifically, a DDO contains a set of key descriptions, which are machine-readable descriptions of the identity owner’s public keys, and a set of service endpoints, which are resource pointers necessary to initiate trusted interactions with the identity owner. Each DID uses a specific DID method, defined in a separate DID method specification, to define how the DID is registered, resolved, updated, and revoked on a specific distributed ledger or network.",

Additional challenges include:\n\nHow can the parties to the data sharing agreement identify and authenticate each other such that they can safely interact for the period of time it is effective?\nHow can such a data sharing agreement be portable, so the parties are not dependent on any particular app or service provider to enforce it?\nHow can such a data sharing agreement be adaptable to different security and privacy policies, so it is not obsoleted as new technologies arrive?",

In recent years discrete logarithm and elliptic curve approaches have become more popular because they allow for improved computational efficiency and smaller key size without diminishing security.\n\nIn the discrete logarithm space, ElGamal-based signature schemes have been the most deployed — thanks in large part to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) releasing their patented DSA under a royalty-free license when implementing the FIPS 186 standard in '93. Even Bitcoin has adopted a variant of DSA: the elliptic-curve based ECDSA, which uses the secp256k1 elliptic curve.",

A PKI's job is to store and retrieve public keys and their respective global identity bindings: identifiers of personal location or accounts controlled by the key's owner and associated with that key. The key is queried via a bound identity attribute (e.g. email address), and the PKI will also return all certificates asserting the validity of these identity bindings.",

We define DID Auth as a ceremony where an identity owner, with the help of various components such as web browsers, mobile devices, and other agents, proves to a relying party that they are in control of a DID. This means demonstrating control of the DID using the mechanism specified in the DID Document's \"authentication\" object. This could take place using a number of different data formats, protocols, and flows. DID Auth includes the ability to establish mutually authenticated communication channels and to authenticate to web sites and applications. Authorization, Verifiable Credentials, and Capabilities are built on top of DID Auth and are out of scope for this document. This paper gives on overview of the scope of DID Auth, supported protocols and flows, and the use of components of the DID Documents that are relevant to authentication, as well as formats for challenges and responses.",

Biometric authentication is increasingly being used on mobile devices to secure private keys and other sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) in some form of trusted platform module (TPM). While on-device biometrics (NOTE: Gartner refers to on-device biometrics as \"local\" biometrics) have advantages for service providers (who want to avoid risks associated with PII loss) and users (who feel they have control of their PII if it is locked on their device), it also has important disadvantages for both users and providers, namely presentation attacks, device attacks, loss of device, and theft.

        "abstract": "This paper reviews the accepted deficits of UN's targets, 16.9: “By 2030 provide legal identity for all including birth registration”, of Sustainable Development Goal 16, and offers proposals that the private technology sector can provide with the aim in achieving this goal. In order for a technology or system to be replaced it only needs to provide a marginal improvement to the current or existing system. Such that the cost of implementation can be realized over a reasonable amount of time, or that the costs are irrelevant because evolving the system is an ethical necessity. In the case of the current standard of centralized identity systems both reasons for change, financial and ethical, are reasonably arguable. There are a vast number ways to improve the efficiency of the current system. As well as an unignorable number of tragic human stories, that provide a humanitarian motive in providing the world with legal identities.",

        "abstract": "Personal Data are valuable resources for creating digital intellectual property (IP). Rights over this IP have generally been unclear, resulting in systematic abuse or unfair use of people's personal data by third parties. But new regulations are changing this - most notably, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR). Third parties must now obtain explicit and documented consent from people (data subjects) to collect, process, store or disclose their personal data. A specification for operationalising these regulatory requirements, using digital Consent Receipts, is being developed through the Consent and Information-Sharing Working Group of the Kantara Initiative. In a parallel effort, COALA-IP has developed a blockchain-ready, community-driven generic protocol for intellectual property licensing that applies the Linked Content Coalition (LCC) framework to \"unify digital rights data management\". This paper proposes a decentralised Smart Consent protocol for managing personal data as intellectual property that combines elements of the COALA-IP Specification for Digital Intellectual Property with the specification for Digital Consent Receipts.",

        "abstract": "Together, physicians and patients steer treatment and are responsible for the vast majority of decisions, and therefore expenditures, in healthcare. Yet the technology that mediates the physician-patient relationship today is not directly purchased or controlled by either the physicians or the patients. Electronic health records and health information exchange technology are sold as strategic assets to institutions — typically very large businesses, that currently have incentives to maximize institutional growth. We seek a better balance of institutional needs with the needs of physicians and patients. This may also solve problems of costs. It is widely accepted that reducing healthcare cost growth requires genuine practice reform. Few institutions, however, are planning to reduce their own size. By focusing health information technology and interoperability on the physician-patient relationship we bypass the inertia of institutions, fertilize the environment for value-based payment, and optimize care options among hospitals, the community, and home, as appropriate.",

Tierion is a universal platform that allows for verification of data at a massive scale. The team behind Tierion saw that businesses have methods for notarizing and safeguarding important documents, but there was not a universal equivalent for the safeguarding of digital data.

Many precious resources will be required for improving and maintaining the security, privacy, and governance of personal data. Methods for storing less personal data will ease the burden of GDPR compliance.

Our goal is to be able to recommend to our citizens and businesses Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) components that are both interoperable with what the Governments of BC and Ontario use and that meets expected privacy and security goals aligned with the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework. A crucial first step in accomplishing that interoperablility is aligning the conventions being used in DIDs and DID Documents (DIDDocs) across DID Method ecosystems.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is twofold - a pre-conference survey of progress made to this point on DIDDoc usage by each DID Method community, and then an attempt at RWoT to \"compare and contrast\" the different approaches to see what can be learned across the wider community and what alignment can be defined at this time that might lead to interoperability.",

        "abstract": "Today we are faced with an unprecidented opportunity to reshape the manner in which we engage with resources represented on the world wide web. At the center of this shift is how we account for trust. In order to unlock the potential of P2P and decentralized transactions taking place between entities, a relational matrix must be constructed. That is, a web of trust to empower digital entities to seamlessly and at low cost/low friction- transact with each other in a regime that can secure the interests of all parties. In other words, the next great internet revolution will take place once we can simultaneously interact with existing systems and their legally binding constructions and a new fabric for Identity and digital assets powered by algorithmic governance.",

It is the goal of this paper to first identify the types of identity systems that have been created in the past as well as newly emerging identity systems. These identity systems can be used in many ways, but they often have many similarities allowing for the comparison of these identity systems. Outlined in this paper is a framework to make these comparisons by relying upon 4 categories that are apart of identity systems. They are verifiability, system architecture, accessibility, and security.",

        "abstract": "Whether your asset is some amount of cryptocurrency, or something else implemented or secured by a smart contract, your asset is tied to a specific blockchain. Almost all of the current consensus algorithms, particularly on the public blockchains, provide only probabilistic guarantees of safety (against byzantine/malicious actors), and those guarantees depend on having a large enough verifier pool for the statistics to hold. Unfortunately, history provides many examples of first movers in a new technology not being the ones who survive in the end. The implication is that any of our current public blockchains (such as Bitcoin) might not be as popular, say, 20 years from now as they are today, resulting in a smaller participant pool and thus a greater safety risk. A way to move such assets, without requiring trust in a commercial asset pooling entity, might be beneficial.",

The first instance “The Sexiest Thing is Trust” a quote from a Toni Amos song on a bumper sticker is referring to interpersonal human to human trust.\n\nThe second instance on a advertisement in the Zurich airport \"Trust. Five extremely demanding letters.\" is talking about trust in organizational systems and processes. It is an advertisement for PICTET “Founded in Geneva in 1805…one of the leading independent wealth and asset managers in Europe”\n\nOne is about deeply human feelings and connection within human relationships the other is about an institutions ability to support individuals hoarding wealth for themselves.",

This zeitgeist can broadly be called decentralized collaboration.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, organizations are atomizing into flexible services and autonomous, purpose-driven small businesses. Deloitte reports the ecosystems of value creation that are emerging create both competitive and collaborative advantage. Several forces are driving this change.\r\n\r\nFreelance work represents a significant driver. Today, freelancers and gig workers make up 34% of the US work force. In keeping with these trends, Intuit and MBO Partners optimistically predict that by 2020 freelancers will represent 43-50% of the work force. Although these numbers may be inflated, there is strong evidence that autonomous work forces are expanding.\r\n\r\nOrganizational functions are unbundling to empower this atomized economy of freelancers and worker hives. Small ventures are freed to focus on core value by leveraging services like Zen Payroll, Zen99, and Zenefits for accounting; Clerky for legal support; gig work through Lyft, Uber, and Thumbtack; WeWork and Impact Hub for co-working.

        "title": "How to Convince Dad* of the Importance of Self-Sovereign Identity",
        "abstract": "One of the major problems with bootstrapping self-sovereign identity is that it requires adoption by a large number of people. Pushing self-sovereign identity from the top-down is most likely to result in a technology that’s not actually used, but instead encouraging the average person to demand self-sovereign identity from the bottom-up will result in the organic development of a vibrant, well-utilized decentralized web-of-trust ecosystem. This paper addresses that need by offering arguments to a variety of people who might be reluctant to use self-sovereign identity, uninterested in its possibilities, or oblivious to the dangers of centralization. By focusing on the needs of real people, we hope to also encourage developers, engineers, and software business owners to create the apps that will address their reluctance and fulfill their needs, making self-sovereign identity a reality.",

Within enterprises, federation eases this burden to some extent by centralizing many of the management aspects, but in the consumer world this added convenience can come with a considerable privacy trade-off.",

Security of most online communication and web traffic depends on the security of these systems. Current PKI systems usually require trusting a central party like Verisign and DNS has many security issues e.g., DNS cache poisoning.\n\nCrypotocurrency blockchains are a potential alternative to traditional DNS and PKI systems that can provide better security and decentralization guarantees. The technology is relatively new and evolving rapidly, little production data or experience is available to guide design tradeoffs. In this paper, we summarize our experience with running a large-scale production deployment of a naming system on top of a cryptocurrency (Namecoin), and discuss how our experience informed the design of a new blockchain-based naming and PKI system called Blockstore.",

It would not only be an extreme success for a more user-centric social network to scale, but would be a shining example of how we could organize to create alternatives to other tech monopolies as well. Success may be improbable but the upsides are so great that it’s worth the risk.\n\nThe fullness of “sovereign identity” is not likely to be realized with a single approach to all domains for identity on the Web. A P2P social media platform is a good focused use case to discuss self sovereign identity. Perhaps we can arrive at a sovereign identity solution for this single app.",

        "abstract": "Traditional cryptographic signature systems are based on strictly-defined authentication and authorization mechanisms that assume a single private key can be used to produce a given signature and that a single public key can be used to verify it. Given the evident limitations of this design, we propose an alternative with more powerful capabities, based on the ability to explicitly outline and fully program conditions for verification. These conditions would then be used to determine when a signature or set of signatures can be considered valid. Our inspiration for this authorization system is the bitcoin scripting language, where the authorization to spend funds is explicitly defined within a script, rather than being implicitly defined through the reference to an authorized public key. The largest benefit of explicit specification of authorization conditions is that the system is fully extensible, so new operations can be defined at any time, with the only limitation being the set of operations that the authorization interpreters understand.",

Regarding employment, the situation is more complex. As an employer, how would I access an employee’s employment history? If this person were blacklisted from other cannabis businesses, should I know? How? Later sections will explore how we plan on tackling this issue.\n\nThough identity will play a central role, governments are slow to respond. Some forward thinking governments have begun adopting decentralized identities, such as the city of Zug and Brazil. However, usage of these identity systems in highly regulated markets such as cannabis remain to be seen. We plan on taking a different approach to adoption.",

        "abstract": "Introduction\nThe term Linked Data is used to describe a recommended best practice for exposing, sharing, and connecting information on the Web using standards, such as URLs, to identify things and their properties. When information is presented as Linked Data, other related information can be easily discovered and new information can be easily linked to it. Linked Data is extensible in a decentralized way, greatly reducing barriers to large scale integration.\n\nWith the increase in usage of Linked Data for a variety of applications, there is a need to be able to verify the authenticity and integrity of Linked Data documents. The Linked Data Signatures specification added authentication and integrity protection to linked data documents through the use of public/private key cryptography without sacrificing Linked Data features such as extensibility and composability.",

We envision such \"DID Resolver\" tools to become as central to SSI infrastructure as DNS is for the web today.\n\nTopics:\n\nThere are different ways how an application or service can use a DID Resolver (e.g. as a natively linked library, or via an HTTP API).\nThere are different ways how a DID Resolver can access a target system (e.g. direct access to a blockchain full node, access using a light client, or access via an intermediary blockchain explorer API).\nThese different deployment scenarios have trust implications. Ideally an application or service should be as \"close\" to a DID Resolver as possible, and the DID Resolver should be as \"close\" to the target systems as possible, in order to minimize intermediaries and attack surfaces.\nA common topic is DID method governance, i.e. which DID methods should a DID Resolver support, and how should this question be governed (see here).",

This paper attempts to describe the role that identity plays in enabling multiple actors, each operating from their own perspective, to rely upon one another to improve their own situational awareness and take action. It then explores the expectations and pressures that identity enables actors to place upon one another, as well as the way that those expectations and pressures can change in response to shifts in the external environment. It details the relationship between privacy and transparency in the identity realm and the impact that this has on the regulation of the community as a complex adaptive system more generally. Finally, it concludes with a series of proposals for specific technical solutions to address some of the tension balancing requirements that are necessary to enable communities to self-regulate amidst changing circumstances.",

        "abstract": "One design element in self-sovereign identity which is becoming common is the idea of decentralized identifiers (DIDs). The ideas is to have an identifier, called a DID, which maps to a descriptor object (DDO) which contains a public key. This mapping can be done in a decentralized way using a blockchain, but other ways could be used as well. The point is that if the root of trust exists in a blockchain, this forms a decentralized PKI (or DPKI). A service interacting with a user would verify a signed message by looking up the DID of the user, mapping this DID to a corresponding key and verifying that the key matches the key that signed the message.\n\nIn a certificate authority based identity system the root of trust is a root key held by a certificate authority (CA). The CA signs certificates containing the keys of sub-CAs which in turn signs keys used by end-users. Thus a service interacting with an end-user can receive a signed message, check the public key that signed the message and follow the certificate chain back to the root CA.",

However, all of the transactions, licensing revenues, interests and equity generated by that intellectual property requires authentication, signatures, verification authorities and trustable timestamping. And so, self-sovereign identity and trust frameworks with algorithmic governance could be used to provide the identity infrastructure needed by the proposed system.

Identity in the physical world has typically been asserted via decentralized mechanisms, mainly paper; i.e., identity is managed individually with claims and attributes that are verified by third parties. Modern computing techniques have centralized this process with various registries and databases that have become repositories for unintentional exploitation. New decentralized technologies, such as blockchains, hash tables and semantic data graphs can enable the design and deployment of a decentralized identity architecture that can vastly improve security and privacy of individuals and entities in the digital world. This will lead to users on the internet becoming individuals with sovereign rights and ownership and control over their digital selves in similar ways that we have control over our physical selves.",

        "abstract": "DKMS (Decentralized Key Management System) is a new approach to cryptographic key management intended for use with blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) where there are no centralized authorities. DKMS inverts a core assumption of conventional PKI (public key infrastructure) architecture, namely that public key certificates will be issued by a relatively small number of centralized or federated certificate authorities (CAs). With DKMS, the initial “root of trust” for all participants is a distributed ledger that supports a new form of root identity record called a DID (decentralized identifier).",

        "abstract": "For the purpose of this document lets replace Blockchain with DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology). DLT is:\n\nA ledger that generally runs in a hostile environment like the public internet\nIt uses cryptography to try and solve identity and ownership problems in this public environment\nIt uses cryptography to try and automate business processes & reduce latency to accelerate the value of money\nAssets are on and managed on the ledger. Off ledger interactions are considered legacy, slow, and inefficient.\nMost real use cases of this technology are theoretical discussions, unimplemented, without a single live use case with enough scalability, security, or appropriate regulatory framework in place.\nThere is no privacy, all transactions are on this public ledger and all parties can see those transactions.\nDLT is the technology not the actual asset. The asset is the application utilizing the DLT (Stock trades, payments, swap trade, currencies, bonds & coupons, etc).\nTransactions are absolute, there is no reverting the transaction. Chargebacks/returns are a business process because the ledger cannot be reversed. You must initiate a transaction back to the originating party.\nCurrent DLT Identity & Data security mechanisms is 'relatively unused' cryptography built for financial services in 1990's. These mathematics has a certain lifetime because computers and distributed calculations are getting faster & more efficient. The current cryptography is not resistive to quantum computer attacks, 5-10yr max additional lifetime, target window 2021-2026.",

        "abstract": "The goal of the \"LD Signature Format Alignment\" Working Group at Rebooting the Web of Trust IV was to investigate the feasibility and impact of the proposed 2017 RSA Signature Suite spec, which brings JSON-LD signatures into alignment with the JOSE JSON Web Signature (JWS) standards. The 2017 RSA Signature Suite is based on RFC 7797, the JSON Web Signature (JWS) Unencoded Payload Option specification. This approach avoids past concerns about JWT raised in the LD signature adopters, including: Increased space consumption associated with base-64 encoding. Difficulty of nesting or chaining signatures, leading to data duplication. Use of a format that is not a JSON object, preventing ability to rely exclusively on a JSON document-based storage engine (while preserving the signature). Using unencoded payloads with detached content, as described in the introduction of RFC 7797, addresses these concerns and helps in cases in which \"...the payload may be very large and where means are already in place to enable the payload to be communicated between the parties without modifications.\" This avoids unnecessary copying and transformations which can result \"significant space and time improvements\" when working with large payloads.",

Like money, reputation gives us access to opportunities, relationships, and resources.\n\nReputation information about people's skills is primarily siloed into centralized systems like Linkedin and Upwork. Because of this the value of reputation on these platforms is limited, for both commerce and accreditation. This value may also disappear unexpectedly when centralized services shut down. Both users and platforms can increase the value of reputation \"currency\" by adopting portable reputation protocols.",

        "title": "Secret Handshake : Key Exchange as a Capability System",
        "abstract": "Secret Handshake is a key exchange with the properties of a capability system - a conceptual framework for the construction of decentralized access control systems.\n\nCapability Systems are an alternative model of operating system security design. Historically, Capability Systems lost out to Access Control Lists (ACL). However, these ideas are due to be reconsidered, because Capability Systems are viable in cryptographic decentralized systems, but ACLs are not.\n\nSecurity systems are about granting and denying access to resources. In the physical world, we can observe a variety of approaches to security that are analogous to both ACLs and Capability Systems. For example, a your car has registration papers, which are like an access control list. These are probably administered by an organization which is administered by your government. Centralized Authority all the way up. If you cannot prove that you own or otherwise have the right to be driving a given car you may be arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle. On the other hand, the car key is analogous to a capability. If you possess the keys to the car, you can start it and drive away. If you give the keys to another driver then they have the same capability to access the car that you do.",

        "abstract": "Despite the advent of password managers, two-factor authentication and single sign-on as-a-service, the need for a more simple, secure and interoperable form of authentication has never been stronger than it is today.\n\nUsers have a multitude of identities and associated credentials to manage, personal data is scattered across dozens of silos, and the last line of defense is almost invariably a password reset email. Within enterprises, federation eases this burden to some extent by centralizing many of the management aspects, but in the consumer world this added convenience can come with a considerable privacy trade-off.",
